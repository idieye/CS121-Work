<h1>Ibrahima Dieye, my biography</h1>

<h2>Who is Ibrahima Dieye?</h2>

<p>My name is Ibrahima Dieye. Since it is apparently hard sometimes to correctly pronounce my first name, my friends usually call me either Ibou or by my surname (pronounce exactly as the letter &ldquo;J&rdquo;). My name can tell you that I&#39;m a muslim. I can speak Wolof, my native language, French, English and little bit of Arabic. I’m a first year student at Macalester College. I live in the first floor of the residential hall named Turck. I’m currently taking five classes: <em>World economic history</em> which is my first year course, <em>Introduction to Islam</em>, <em>Introduction to scientific programming</em>, <em>Single variable calculus</em>, and <em>Supplementary writing workshop</em> which is a one-credit course designed to introduce non-native speakers to college level writing. I’m currently involved in the Lives of Commitment leadership program, which consists of making reflexions about the meaning of life, spirituality etc. and taking actions to make a difference for a better world. I’m also definitely joining Mac Afrika!, the Muslim student Association and perhaps an intermural sports team if I can fit it in my weekly timetable. But, hang on a second: Why the hell would a Senegalese do at Macalester College? How did he know about Macalester College in the first place? The answers to these questions lie at the heart of my background I’ll try to summarize in three paragraphs. </p>

<h2>A little bit of background</h2>

<p>I was born on Sunday 17th January, 1993 in Dakar, the capital city of Senegal, a small country located the extreme west of the African continent. My father, Mamadou, is by profession a car mechanic but currently works as a driver. My mother, Aminata Sogue, is a housewife, though she times sells a few items to make some money for the house. I&#39;m the brother of four beautiful young girls: Khady (17), Ndeye (14), Awa (9) and Fatou (6). Until 2011, I have spent my whole life in the suburban area of Dakar with my family. Initially, we lived in Grand-Medine, a popular &ldquo;village&#39; where I grew up. I have a lot of friends who are living there still and some who moved up to other places, but I&#39;m still in touch with most of them. It&#39;s hard to lose good childhood friends, isn&#39;t? Then when I was in grade 10, we moved to another part of the suburb named Parcelles Assainies.</p>

<p>I started school at Grand-Medine Primary school. With oustanding grades, I was sometimes selected as a representive of my school for various competitions in maths, french and other subjects. I graduated from primary school in 2005 and joined LyMoDak secondary school (which also is a high school) where I was very successful. I won loads of awards and won a lot of academic competitions the most rewarding of which occurred in 2011. In fact, on August 2011 I was one of the three students selected amongst hundreds of applicants to attend a United World College. The national commity, which is the main organization in charge of the selection process, selected me to join United World College of South East Asia (UWCSEA), which is apparently one of the ten most expensive schools in the world. I thought it was mainly because of luck that I got the full scholarship that enabled me to attend this school. But, after my brilliant academic performance there, I came to realize that I diserved that scholarship more than any other student. </p>

<p>The whole university application process was really stressful, even more so when your intended destination is the United Sates. A lot of tests to take, a lot of forms to fill out, a lot essays to write. I cannot be bothered, at this point, to tell a whole story about where it all started and ended. I&#39;m just going to say that I&#39;m thrilled to be a Macalester student. If I&#39;m actually a Scot, this is in part because my University adviseor told me so many great things about this school that made me decline a few offers and withdraw a few applications. So far, I&#39;m not disappoined about my choice. I&#39;ve met so many nice people. Although the academis seems very rigourous, the teachers are always ready to help, which makes it less difficult. Orientation was pretty overwhelming, but it prepared me for a lot of aspects of college. I really can&#39;t complain. That&#39;s about it, for now! Later!</p>
